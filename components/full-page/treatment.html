        Acute bronchitis typically resolves on its own within a couple of weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your condition is caused by bacteria, which is uncommon, your doctor
        might prescribe antibiotics. They may recommend an inhaler if you have
        asthma, allergies, or wheezing. This aids in opening the airways, making
        it easier to breathe.

        You can drink a lot of water to alleviate the symptoms of acute
        bronchitis. Daily consumption of eight to twelve glasses of water helps
        thin mucus and makes coughing easier.

        Take nonprescription pain relievers. Aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen
        are analgesics that relieve pain. Avoid giving children aspirin,
        however. Acetaminophen is effective against both pain and fever.
      </p>
      <p>
        Utilize nonprescription cough medicines. You may take a medication such
        as guaifenesin during the day to loosen mucus and make coughing easier.
        This is known as an expectorant by your doctor. Before administering any
        cough medicine to a child, you should consult a pediatrician.
