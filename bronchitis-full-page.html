            Bronchitis arises whenever the bronchial tubes that supply air to
            the human lungs get inflamed and enlarged; it is merely a swelling
            in the airways of a human (bronchi). The Bronchi link the trachea
            (windpipe) to the human lungs' small air sacs (alveoli) and the body
            absorbs oxygen through the alveolar walls. Consequently, Bronchitis
            causes the bronchi to expand and be filled with sticky mucus; this
            makes breathing difficult and prompts a person to cough. Bronchitis
            may be either

            A hacking cough that may last anywhere from one to three weeks in
            duration. If you have bronchitis and cough, you will most likely
            bring up mucus, but it is possible that you could have a dry cough
            instead. When you breathe, you could also hear a noise that sounds
            like rattling or whistling (wheezing). It's possible that you'll
            have cold-like symptoms if you have acute bronchitis, such as a
            minor headache or body pains. Even though you should start to feel
            better in about a week, you could have a persistent cough that lasts
            for a few weeks longer than normal.
          </p>

          <p>
            A productive cough that has lasted for at least three months, with
            repeating cases occurring for at least two years in a row, is
            considered to be the defining characteristic of chronic bronchitis.
            People who suffer from chronic bronchitis are more prone to have
            bouts in which their cough or other symptoms become more severe.
            When this occurs, you run the risk of having an acute infection on
            top of the chronic bronchitis you already have.

          <p>
            Risk factors are characteristics at the biological, psychological
            and community levels that precede and are associated with a higher
            likelihood of negative outcomes. These can include physical, social
            and environmental factors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cigarette smoke. People who smoke or who live with a smoker are at
            higher risk of both acute bronchitis and chronic bronchitis.
          </p>

          <p>
            Low resistance. This may result from another acute illness, such as
            a cold, or from a chronic condition that compromises your immune
            system. Older adults, infants and young children have greater
            vulnerability to infection.
          </p>

          <p>
            Exposure to irritants on the job. Your risk of developing bronchitis
            is greater if you work around certain lung irritants, such as grains
            or textiles, or are exposed to chemical fumes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gastric reflux. Repeated bouts of severe heartburn can irritate your
            throat and make you more prone to developing bronchitis.

          <h4>Acute vs. Chronic Bronchitis</h4>
          <p>
            Before discussing the complications of bronchitis, it’s important to
            distinguish the two different kinds, as both the symptoms and impact
            can vary significantly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Acute Bronchitis often occurs at the tail end of a cold or the flu.
            Instead of improving, a person may develop a low-grade fever and a
            bothersome cough. Roughly 90% of the time, acute bronchitis is viral
            in origin, so antibiotics are not helpful. Home remedies may ease
            the symptoms until they resolve on their own, though a cough may
            persist for several weeks.
          </p>

          <p>
            Chronic Bronchitis is considered by many to be a form of chronic
            obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is characterized by a daily
            cough (often productive of large amounts of phlegm) that lasts for
            at least three months. In addition to coughing, symptoms such as
            shortness of breath (dyspnea), chest pain, and weight loss may
            occur.

            <p>
              While acute bronchitis usually runs its course, complications such
              as secondary bacterial infection (“superinfection”) may occur in
              5% to 10% of people.

              Streptococcus pneumoniae (the bacteria that causes pneumococcal

          <p>To reduce your risk of bronchitis, follow these tips:</p>
        </header>

        <div class="prevention__content">
          <p>
            Avoid cigarette smoke. Cigarette smoke increases your risk of
            chronic bronchitis. Get vaccinated. Many cases of acute bronchitis
            result from influenza, a virus. Getting a yearly flu vaccine can
            help protect you from getting the flu. You may also want to consider
            vaccination that protects against some types of pneumonia. Wash your
            hands. To reduce your risk of catching a viral infection, wash your
            hands frequently and get in the habit of using alcohol-based hand
            sanitizers. Wear a surgical mask. If you have COPD, you might
            consider wearing a face mask at work if you're exposed to dust or
            fumes, and when you're going to be among crowds, such as while
            traveling.

            Acute bronchitis typically resolves on its own within a couple of
            weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your condition is caused by bacteria, which is uncommon, your
            doctor might prescribe antibiotics. They may recommend an inhaler if
            you have asthma, allergies, or wheezing. This aids in opening the
            airways, making it easier to breathe.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can drink a lot of water to alleviate the symptoms of acute
            bronchitis. Daily consumption of eight to twelve glasses of water
            helps thin mucus and makes coughing easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            Take nonprescription pain relievers. Aspirin, ibuprofen, and
            naproxen are analgesics that relieve pain. Avoid giving children
            aspirin, however. Acetaminophen is effective against both pain and
            fever.
          </p>
          <p>
            Utilize nonprescription cough medicines. You may take a medication
            such as guaifenesin during the day to loosen mucus and make coughing
            easier. This is known as an expectorant by your doctor. Before
            administering any cough medicine to a child, you should consult a
            pediatrician.
