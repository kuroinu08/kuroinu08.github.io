              Inhalation and exhalation are how your body brings in oxygen and
              gets rid of carbon dioxide. The process gets help from a large
              dome-shaped muscle under your lungs called the diaphragm.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you breathe in, your diaphragm pulls downward, creating a
              vacuum that causes a rush of air into your lungs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The opposite happens with exhalation: Your diaphragm relaxes
              upward, pushing on your lungs, allowing them to deflate.

              As a result, the humidification that your lungs and respiratory

            Bronchitis arises whenever the bronchial tubes that supply air to
            the human lungs get inflamed and enlarged; it is merely a swelling
            in the airways of a human (bronchi). The Bronchi link the trachea
            (windpipe) to the human lungs' small air sacs (alveoli) and the body
            absorbs oxygen through the alveolar walls. Consequently, Bronchitis
            causes the bronchi to expand and be filled with sticky mucus; this
            makes breathing difficult and prompts a person to cough. Bronchitis

            links the nostrils with the larynx, which is the next respiratory

            each of the bronchi. Therefore, the intrapulmonary section of the

            The two bronchi give birth to a number of branches, which are known
            collectively as the bronchioles. The bronchi grow into ever-smaller
            bronchioles, as though branching off of a tree, until they encompass
            the whole internal capacity of the lungs. There are around 300,000

            continuing to convey air, in this instance to the alveoli.

          <p>
            The pleura is a membrane made of connective tissue that borders each
            lung and only permits two openings: those of the two bronchi. In
            this context, the pleura functions as the lung covering; in
            addition, it is covered by a mucosa that maintains the lubrication
            of the lungs and helps keep the lungs moist.

          <p>
            We are now going to move on from the lung and examine another
            structure that is an important component of the respiratory system
            despite the fact that it is not directly engaged in the passage of
            air. We are speaking about the diaphragm, which is a muscle that has
            the form of a dome and is placed underneath the lungs. It tightens
            up in order to assist the lungs operate properly during inspiration,
            and then it relaxes during exhalation.
